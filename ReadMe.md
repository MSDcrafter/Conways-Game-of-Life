This is a little Project i did a while ago,
and i thouht i would upload it to github to test out how git works.

It started with me programming Conways Game of Life in Python.
The file was originally around 5kb large, so i thought i would optimize it
(The original file is also be included in the repo, if you havent noticed already)

This project uses the pygame library, but doesnt otherwise depend on any other libraries
